How to generate data? Robotoff is an API that pulls prediction data, annotation data, product data, nutrition data from MongoDB database in Open Food Facts server. If your development instance is not connected to a product-opener instance (which happens automatically if you have a running product-opener instance), you won't have a MongoDB instance. This means you won't have any product data on your local set up. Though you may populate your postgres database with some predictions, insights, images references, etc. We recommend Factory to create some data in your local database. If you have installed Robotoff via Docker, you can run Python using Poetry and execute Factory like so: $ docker-compose run --rm api poetry run python ... > from tests.integration.models_utils import * > PredictionFactory() NOTE: If you are on Windows we recommend using Git bash to run commands. How to run test cases? We use pytest to run test cases and Makefile to run our commands. The following command will run all the test cases one by one: $ make tests How to run a single test case? The simplest is to use the pytest make target for that: make pytest args = 'path/to/test_file.py::the_function_name' For example, to call test_get_type() from tests/unit/insights/test_importer.py : $ make pytest args = \"tests/unit/insights/test_importer.py::TestLabelInsightImporter::test_get_type\" Remember to put quotes especially if you have multiple arguments. NOTE : Be sure to run make create_external_networks before if needed (especially if you get Network po_test declared as external, but could not be found ) When to write your own test cases? Write test cases every time you write a new feature, to test a feature or to understand the working of an existing function. Automated testing really helps to prevent future bugs as we introduce new features or refactor the code. There are even cases where automated tests are your only chance to test you code. For example: when you write code to post notifications on Slack channel you can only test them by writing a unit test case. There are instances when Robotoff tries to connect to MongoDB via Open Food Facts server. For local testing we do not yet provide a standarized approach to add a MongoDB Docker in the same network and configure Robotoff to use it. In such cases you will have to mock the function which calls MongoDB. Feel free to reuse the existing test cases. To identify parts of the code where Robotoff connects to MongoDB or to Open Food Facts server (the part you should mock), keep an eye for variables like server_url , server_domain or settings.OFF_SERVER_DOMAIN . Debugging guide We encourage using PDB to debug. Running test with --pdb flags, pytest will stop and open the pdb console as soon as there is an error or an assert fails. This can be a good way to try to understand why a test is failing. make pytest args = \"path/to/test.py --pdb\" If it's a mock.assert_called_with , you can look at the real data passed to a test case by calling mock.call_args in the pdb console. If you need more precise control to see code path before it breaks, you can add the following lines in your function to find out what your code does and where it breaks. import pdb ; pdb . set_trace () and then run the pytest , with the --pdb option (as above). Note we need the --pdb option, to view the inputs and outputs captured by pytest and access the pdb console.","title":"Test and debug"},{"location":"how-to-guides/test-and-debug/#test-and-debug","text":"","title":"Test and debug"},{"location":"how-to-guides/test-and-debug/#this-documentation-intends-to","text":"1) Familiarize you on running our test cases. 2) Give you some tips from getting stuck if you are working only on Robotoff and don't need complete installation of Open Food Facts server.","title":"This documentation intends to:"},{"location":"how-to-guides/test-and-debug/#how-to-generate-data","text":"Robotoff is an API that pulls prediction data, annotation data, product data, nutrition data from MongoDB database in Open Food Facts server.

Each time a contributor uploads a new image on Open Food Facts, the text on this image is extracted using Google Cloud Vision, an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) service. Robotoff receives a new event through a webhook each time this occurs, with the URLs of the image and the resulting OCR (as a JSON file). We use simple string matching algorithms to find patterns in the OCR text to generate new predictions 3 . We also use a ML model to extract objects from images. 4 One model tries to detect any logo 6 . Detected logos are then embedded in a vector space using a pre-trained model. In this space we use a k-nearest-neighbor approach to try to classify the logo, predicting a brand or a label. Hunger game also collects users annotations to have ground truth ( logo game ). Another model tries to detect the grade of the Nutri-Score (A to E) with a computer vision model. The above detections generate predictions which in turn generate many types of insights 5 : labels stores packager codes packaging product weight expiration date brand ... Predictions, as well as insights are stored in the PostgreSQL database. These new insights are then accessible to all annotation tools (Hunger Games, mobile apps,...), that can validate or not the insight. If the insight is validated by an authenticated user, it's applied immediately and the product is updated through Product Opener API 8 . If it's reported as invalid, no update is performed, but the insight is marked as annotated so that it is not suggested to another annotator. If the user is not authenticated, a system of votes is used (3 consistent votes trigger the insight application). Some insights with high confidence are applied automatically, 10 minutes after import. Robotoff is also notified by Product Opener every time a product is updated or deleted 7 . This is used to delete insights associated with deleted products, or to update them accordingly.

Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement. Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome. Get Started! Ready to contribute code? Here's how to set up Robotoff for local development. Fork the robotoff repo on GitHub. Clone your fork locally: git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/robotoff.git 3. choose between docker install (recommended) or local install and run it. code! When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8, mypy and the tests. In addition, ensure that your code is formatted using black: If you are on Windows, make sure you have Make for Windows installed. Don't forget to add its path in your system environment variables . A sample path may look like this: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuWin32\\bin It is recommended to use Window's default command prompt instead of Power shell for smooth installation. If you are using docker: make lint make checks make tests To test the APIs on your localhost run docker-compose up You can make a post request through Postman or simply paste the url in a web browser to make a get request like this one http://localhost:5500/api/v1/insights/ The mapping of functions and API path is at the end of robotoff/app/api.py If you are on a local install: flake8 black --check . mypy . isort --check . poetry run pytest tests Before running the test cases make sure you have a database created. Have a look at .env and robotoff/settings.py the default database name, user, and password is postgres Configure them through environment (you may use .env if you use docker) as you like. We don't provide sample database as of now but you'll have a database structure ready to start working.

Here's how to set up Robotoff for local development. Fork the robotoff repo on GitHub. Clone your fork locally: git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/robotoff.git 3. choose between docker install (recommended) or local install and run it. code! When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8, mypy and the tests. In addition, ensure that your code is formatted using black: If you are on Windows, make sure you have Make for Windows installed. Don't forget to add its path in your system environment variables . A sample path may look like this: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\GnuWin32\\bin It is recommended to use Window's default command prompt instead of Power shell for smooth installation. If you are using docker: make lint make checks make tests To test the APIs on your localhost run docker-compose up You can make a post request through Postman or simply paste the url in a web browser to make a get request like this one http://localhost:5500/api/v1/insights/ The mapping of functions and API path is at the end of robotoff/app/api.py If you are on a local install: flake8 black --check . mypy . isort --check . poetry run pytest tests Before running the test cases make sure you have a database created. Have a look at .env and robotoff/settings.py the default database name, user, and password is postgres Configure them through environment (you may use .env if you use docker) as you like. We don't provide sample database as of now but you'll have a database structure ready to start working.

As an example, we can print the product name of all complete products from France that have ingredients in French with: from robotoff.products import ProductDataset ds = ProductDataset . load () product_iter = ( ds . stream () . filter_by_country_tag ( 'en:france' ) . filter_nonempty_text_field ( 'ingredients_text_fr' ) . filter_by_state_tag ( 'en:complete' ) . iter ()) for product in product_iter : print ( product [ 'product_name' ]) We first lazily load the dataset using ProductDataset.load() . Then, we create a ProductStream using the ProductDataset.stream() method, and apply filters on the stream of products. The following filters are currently available: filter_by_country_tag filter_by_state_tag filter_nonempty_text_field filter_empty_text_field filter_nonempty_tag_field filter_empty_tag_field filter_by_modified_datetime Play with the taxonomies Taxonomies contains items (such as ingredients, labels or categories) organized in a hierarchical way. Some items are children of other items. For instance, en:brown-rice is a child of en:rice . from robotoff.taxonomy import get_taxonomy # supported taxonomies: ingredient, category, label taxonomy = get_taxonomy ( 'category' ) brown_rice = taxonomy [ 'en:brown-rices' ] rice = taxonomy [ 'en:rices' ] print ( brown_rice ) # Output: <TaxonomyNode en:brown-rices> print ( brown_rice . children ) # Output: [<TaxonomyNode en:brown-jasmine-rices>, <TaxonomyNode en:brown-basmati-rices>] assert brown_rice . is_child_of ( rice ) assert rice . is_parent_of ( brown_rice ) assert brown_rice . get_localized_name ( 'fr' ) == 'Riz complet' # find_deepest_item takes a list of string as input and outputs a string deepest_node = taxonomy . find_deepest_nodes ([ rice , brown_rice ]) assert deepest_node == [ brown_rice ] print ( brown_rice . get_synonyms ( 'fr' )) # Output: ['Riz complet', 'riz cargo', 'riz brun', 'riz semi-complet'] print ( brown_rice . get_parents_hierarchy ()) # Output: [<TaxonomyNode en:rices>, <TaxonomyNode en:cereal-grains>, <TaxonomyNode en:cereals-and-their-products>, <TaxonomyNode en:cereals-and-potatoes>, <TaxonomyNode en:plant-based-foods>, <TaxonomyNode en:plant-based-foods-and-beverages>, <TaxonomyNode en:seeds>]","title":"Package reference"},{"location":"references/package/#package-reference","text":"Robotoff is deployed on a web server, but is also distributed as a library.

This pipeline helped us build the first annotated logo dataset so that we can now measure how the original EfficientNet-b0 model (pretrained on ImageNet) performs compared to other pretrained models. Logo embeddings were computed using each model. For each logo, the L2 distance was used to find the most similar logos among the rest of the dataset, and results were sorted by ascending distance. To keep the comparison fair and avoid favoring classes with many samples, for each target image, we only considered at most 4 items of each class. These items were sampled at random among the class items. As each class contains at least 5 items, all classes (including the target class, i.e. the class of the target logo) have 4 candidates. With this setting, an oracle model would have a recall@4 of 1. The val split was used to perform this benchmark. The benchmark code can be found here . We use the following metrics: micro-recall@4 : skewed by classes with many samples. macro-recall@4 : gives equal weight to all classes. All compared models were trained on ImageNet, except: beit_large_patch16_224_in22k , trained on ImageNet 22k clip-vit-* , trained on the proprietary dataset described in the CLIP paper . Note that we use the timm library to generate embeddings (except for CLIP models, where the transformers library was used). The model weights mostly come from the timm author's training and differ from the original weights.

Its performances are competitive compared to most other architectures pretrained on ImageNet. However, CLIP models largely outperform any other tested architecture on this benchmark: with clip-vit-large-patch14 we gain +22.8 on micro-recall@4 and +30.9 on macro-recall@4 compared to efficientnet-b0 . Performances of CLIP models increase as models gets larger or with a smaller image patch size. The prediction latency is however 3.8x and 18,4x higher for clip-vit-base-patch16 and clip-vit-large-patch14 respectively compared to clip-vit-base-patch32 . In conclusion, CLIP models are very good candidates for an off-the-shelf replacement of the efficientnet-b0 model currently used to generate logo embeddings.
