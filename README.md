**Robotoff** is a service managing potential Open Food Facts updates (also known as _insights_) and predictions (which can then be combined to generate an insight).
These insights include a growing set of facts, including:

- the product category, weight, brand, packager codes and expiration date
- some of its labels
- abusive pictures (selfies)
- rotated pictures
- ingredient spellchecking

Robotoff provides an API to:

- Fetch insights
- Annotate an insight (accept or reject)

Once generated, the insights can be applied automatically, or after a manual validation if necessary. A scheduler regularly marks insights for automatic annotation and sends the update to Open Food Facts.

A detailed description of [how predictions and insights work is available here](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/robotoff/robotoff/explanations/predictions/).

Robotoff works together with [Product Opener](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server), the Core server of Open Food Facts (in Perl, which can also be installed locally using Docker) and the [Open Food Facts apps](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app) (which can work with your local instance after enabling dev mode)
