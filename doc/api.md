# Robotoff

Robotoff provides a simple API allowing consumers to fetch predictions and annotate them.
All endpoints must be prefixed with `/api/v1` (the full URL being `https://robotoff.openfoodfacts.org/api/v1/{endpoint}`)
Robotoff can interact with all Openfoodfacts products: Openfoodfacts, Openbeautyfacts, etc. and all 
environments (production, development, pro). The `server_domain` field should be used to specify the 
product/environment: `api.openfoodfacts.org` for OFF-prod, `api.openfoodfacts.net` for OFF-dev, 
`api.openbeautyfacts.org` for OBF-prod,...
