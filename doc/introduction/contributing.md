# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at <https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff/issues>.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in
  troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it. Issues tagged with "good first issue" are suitable for newcomers.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

Robotoff could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official [Robotoff docs](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff/tree/master/doc) or in docstrings.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
<https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff/issues>.

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to
  implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that
  contributions are welcome

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up Robotoff for local
development.

1.  Fork the robotoff repo on GitHub.
2.  Clone your fork locally:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/robotoff.git
    ```

3.  Install the dependencies using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation):

    ```
    poetry install
    ```

4.  Configure files required for the tests to run locally:
    
    Download the Robotoff models:
    ```
    poetry run robotoff-cli download-models
    ```

    Compile the i18n files:
    ```
    cd i18n && bash compile.sh && cd ..
    ```

5.  Create a branch for local development:

    ```
    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

6.  When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8, mypy and the tests. In addition, ensure that your code is formatted using black:

    ```
    flake8
    black --check .
    mypy . services/ann
    isort --check .
    poetry run pytest tests
    ```

7.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

    In brief, commit messages should follow these conventions:

    > - Always contain a subject line which briefly describes the changes made. For example "Update CONTRIBUTING.rst".
    > - Subject lines should not exceed 50 characters.
    > - The commit body should contain context about the change - how the code worked before, how it works now and why you decided to solve the issue in the way you did.

8.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request should include tests.
2.  If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring.
3.  The pull request should work for Python 3.7 and above. Check <https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff/actions> and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
