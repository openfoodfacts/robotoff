      summary: Submit an annotation
      operationId: annotateInsight
      description: |
        The annotation can be submitted as an anonymous user or as a registered user.
        If the user is anonymous, the annotation will be accounted as a vote, and several identical
        anonymous votes are required to apply the insight. If the vote is sent from a registered user,
        it is applied directly.

        To send the annotation as a registered user, send Open Food Facts credentials to the API using
        Basic Authentication: add a `Authorization: basic {ENCODED_BASE64}` header where `{ENCODED_BASE64}`
        is an base64-encoded string of `user:password`. Don't provide an authentication header for anonymous
        users.

        The annotation is an integer that can take 4 values: `0`, `1`, `2`, `-1`. `0` means the insight is incorrect
        (so it won't be applied), `1` means it is correct (so it will be applied) and `-1` means the insight
        won't be returned to the user (_skip_). `2` is used when user submit some data to the annotate endpoint 
        (for example in some cases of category annotation or ingredients spellcheck).

        We use the voting mecanism system to remember which insight to skip for a user (authenticated or not).

        Predictions are performed using a neural model.
        As input, you can either provide:

        - the `barcode` of a product: Robotoff will fetch the product from
          Product Opener and will use this data as inputs to predict categories.
        - expected inputs under a `product` key. The neural category model
          accepts the following fields as input: `product_name`, `ingredients_tags`,
          `ocr`, `nutriments`, `image_embeddings`. All fields are optional (but you should at least provide one).

          description: |
            the value tag of the prediction. The use of this field depends of the prediction type,
